## Yukun Ma's Home Page

I'm currently a senior specialist in AIR Labs of Continental Automotive Group. I got my PhD from NTU in the year 2018. I was also a Research Associate with the Rolls-Royce@NTU Corporate Lab where I enjoyed a 4-years happy time under supervision of Erik Cambria. 

This page serves as a humble place for a updated record of my recent research.
